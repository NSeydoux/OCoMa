# OCoMa
OCoMa stands for Open Comic book Manager. It is intended to be a collection manager for comic books, based on a knowledge base, and provisionned by remote APIs to automatically fill in information fields. 

## Semantic data model
OCoMa's data model is open, flexible and machine-understandable. It is based on the S. Petiya's Comic Book Ontology (Petiya, S. (2015). Comic Book Ontology. Retrieved from http://comicmeta.org/cbo). The example provided in the semantic folder comes from Mr Petiya's github page : https://github.com/comicmeta/ComicBookOntology
